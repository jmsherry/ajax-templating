#Client-side Templating, AJAX & APIs

The aim of this repo is to give you an idea of how the above topics work. If you `git clone` the repo you'll be able to fiddle with the code involved and try some for yourself.

I try to give the full picture as much as I can and have various asides in blue which are additional information and not central to what we're doing but are still useful.

To do the pre-compilation of templates you could do `npm i` to get the Handlebars compiler and CLI. I reckon it's better for you to do `npm i -g handlebars`, however, so you can use handlebars anywhere in your projects, rather than just in this one.
